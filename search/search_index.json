You may choose to rely on AppSTARTer for various changes to your application installs, or use it as a stepping stone and learn to do more advanced configurations and connecting applications together. Getting Started System Requirements You must be running a supported system (listed below). You must be logged in as a non-root user with sudo permissions. One Time Setup (required) APT Systems (Debian, Ubuntu, etc) sudo apt-get install curl git bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://ghostwriters.github.io/AppSTARTer/main.sh)\" sudo reboot DNF Systems (Fedora) Not currently supported, but planned to be in the future! YUM Systems (CentOS) Not currently supported, but planned to be in the future! Running AppSTARTer sudo apps To run AppSTARTer use the command above. You should now see the main menu. Currently, it is recommended to do Configuration > Select Apps as any other menu option just takes you through prompts to set variables that aren't currently used. Support Click the chat badge to join us on Discord for support! [ Feature Request ] [ Bug Report ] Contributors This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute! Special Thanks In addition to all those mentioned on [ DockSTARTer ] we would also like to thank [ GhostWriters ] for being willing to partner and work with us to create AppSTARTer!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"#system-requirements","text":"You must be running a supported system (listed below).

AppSTARTer comes with configurations to install various apps. AppSTARTer can be operated through a friendly GUI of terminal menus. AppSTARTer can be operated through commands for more advanced users who do not prefer the GUI. AppSTARTer is here to give you the freedom to choose what you want to run. AppSTARTer allows you to run apps that are not included. What AppSTARTer Is Not AppSTARTer is not a premade set of apps that run an exact way (you get to choose what to run and how to run it). AppSTARTer does not configure apps for you (think of it more like installing apps as a service, settings inside the app are still up to you, although our documentation will have reocmmendations). AppSTARTer does not configure storage for you (you may use local storage, or cloud storage, multiple disks, raid, etc). System Requirements Supported Operating Systems You must be running a Supported platform or an operating system based on a supported platform. With AppSTARTer being new, we are currently only supporting Ubuntu and Debian based systems. In the future, we will be supporting more, like CentOS and Fedora. AppSTARTer will attempt to perform this install for you, if possible. Supported Hardware Currently, any x86_64 , armv7l , or aarch64 system should be able to run one of the supported operating systems listed above. ARM CPUs may have a limited selection of supported containers. Windows Support Currently we recommend installing one of the supported platforms above in a VM. In the future we may be able to support the Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#what-appstarter-is","text":"AppSTARTer is a script that installs general dependencies for you.
