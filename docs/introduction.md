# Introduction

## What AppSTARTer Is

- AppSTARTer is a script that installs general dependencies for you.
- AppSTARTer comes with configurations to install various apps.
- AppSTARTer can be operated through a friendly GUI of terminal menus.
- AppSTARTer can be operated through commands for more advanced users who do not prefer the GUI.
- AppSTARTer is here to give you the freedom to choose what you want to run.
- AppSTARTer allows you to run apps that are not included.

## What AppSTARTer Is Not

- AppSTARTer is not a premade set of apps that run an exact way (you get to choose what to run and how to run it).
- AppSTARTer does not configure apps for you (think of it more like installing apps as a service, settings inside the app are still up to you, although our documentation will have reocmmendations).
- AppSTARTer does not configure storage for you (you may use local storage, or cloud storage, multiple disks, raid, etc).

## System Requirements

### Supported Operating Systems

You must be running a Supported platform or an operating system based on a supported platform. With AppSTARTer being new, we are currently only supporting Ubuntu and Debian based systems. In the future, we will be supporting more, like CentOS and Fedora.

AppSTARTer will attempt to perform this install for you, if possible.

### Supported Hardware

Currently, any `x86_64`, `armv7l`, or `aarch64` system should be able to run one of the supported operating systems listed above. ARM CPUs may have a limited selection of supported containers.

### Windows Support

Currently we recommend installing one of the supported platforms above in a VM. In the future we may be able to support the Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2.
