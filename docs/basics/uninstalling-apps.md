# Uninstalling Apps

You can uninstall any apps that have been installed via AppSTARTer by doing one of the following:

1. Deselecting the application(s) via the GUI when running `apps`. Then answering "Yes" when prompted to uninstall disabled apps. It will then ask you if you want to uninstall the app for each one that has been deselected
2. Running `apps --uninstall=<app_name>` where `<app_name>` is the name of the app you want to uninstall. Example: `apps --uninstall=sonarr`
